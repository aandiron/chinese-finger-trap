% This story is about a girl who meets a dude at a concert.
% He recognizes her from some previous event, and says hi. She's shy but admits she reconizes him too.
% They flirt casually, for a bit, and then his friend returns from the bathroom. All three hit it off.
% They end up back at the friend's apartment nearby, after the show.
% It turns into a threesome, with her jacking both of them off.
% Turns out, she's Chinese. The idea of "fingercuffs" is of course never mentioned, other than the title.
