% This story is about a girl who meets a dude at a concert.
% He recognizes her from some previous event, and says hi. She's shy but admits she reconizes him too.
% They flirt casually, for a bit, and then his friend returns from the bathroom. All three hit it off.
% They end up back at the friend's apartment nearby, after the show.
% It turns into a threesome, with her jacking both of them off. And that of course turns into DP, and that turns into fingercuffs.
% Turns out, she's Chinese. The idea of "fingercuffs" is of course never mentioned, other than the title.
% How do you get the topic of chinese to come up? Do they order chinese food? This should be the delicate/subtle part. talking about family? or talking about some celbrity who is half asian but doesn't look it - Brandon Lee? That's nice because she can think something like "you idiot" before gently correcting him. This could have nice tones about millenials and modern generations, without getting specific about that crap. Could related to millenial sexual habits as well. Except that nobody but gen xers would know who brandon lee was.
% told from her perspective? I think so.
% But what's the larger theme? something about how she doesn't want any dudes, but in fact needs two dudes. That she is the "trap". That she needs it in both ends. That they can't get it out once they are in, she holds them there.
% How do I get around names for them? I hate naming characters.  One is hirsute - Hairy? and the other is Tall.
